# Template for a library with React + TypeScript + Vite

- `build:site` build the website to `docs`, so it can be served on github pages
- `build:lib` build the library to `dist`, where `package.json` expects it

**NOTE: Make sure to search and replace all instances of `"NEW_LIB"` with the appropriate value for your library**
